Finite State Machine 1:
This_is_the_output_from_the_first_FSM.
Finite State Machine 2:
Testing for proper handling of \b and \\.
Finite State Machine 3:
The third FSM is correct (it handles \c correctly).
Finite State Machine 4:
Th*s *s *n *x*mpl* fr*m th* pr*bl*m st*t*m*nt, w*th d*ff*r*nt t*xt.
Finite State Machine 5:
XXx     Test   Xo  iXx (This is also from the problem statement).
Finite State Machine 6:
ThIs is sOme dAta fOr the FSM. ThEre wIll be twO linEs of OutpUt.
The lAst word On this lIne Is FINiS.
Finite State Machine 7:
This FSM does work.
