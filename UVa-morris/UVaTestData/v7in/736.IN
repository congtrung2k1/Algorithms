The contest will be held on Saturday, October  30,
1993.    Contestants  will  have a  period of five
hours (12:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. CST) in   which  to
solve a total of six  programming  problems.  Each
team   will compete in one of two Regional Contest
Divisions:   Division 1  (open  to any  team)   or
Division    2   (open to  teams  of  undergraduate
students only).  A   Regional Contest Divison must
be  declared  by the faculty  sponsor before 10:25
a.m. on  October  30,  1993.   Teams  without   an
officially  declared  Contest Divison at this time
will       compete            in      Divison   1.
     Contestants may  bring  any  source materials
intended  for  human  use  such as books, manuals,
program      listings,     and     nonprogrammable
calculators.    No   machine-readable   aids   are
allowed.  All materials accompanying a team to the
contest   must   be  examined  and approved by the
Satellite Site Coordinator before the start of the
                                          contest.
     Teams and faculty  advisors will be separated
at 10:30  for  their  respective meetings and will
not be   reunited until after the  contest results
at their    site    have       been    determined.
     A   team may  be disqualified by the Regional
Contest Director at the request of any   Satellite
Site official  for any  activity that violates the
rules or jeopardizes the integrity of the contest.
     A     public message board will be maintained
throughout the contest   period.  Check this board
periodically for   messages   from   the   contest
administration   and   interim   contest  results.
     Each   site will   establish   its own policy
regarding   the   manipulation of the contest data
files.  Typically,  teams will read their own test
input from the same disk that contains the program
source.  For judging   purpose, however, all input
must occur from the judges' secret data file (on a
hard   drive, for example).  Therefore contestants
may be required to modify their programs when they
are submitted for judging.   Output will typically
be written to the screen or to a new datafile.  Be
certain that  you  understand  the  policy at your
site.     A general  clarification   stating   the
procedure   in  effect at your site will be issued
during      the      contestant's         meeting.
     Once  the   contest  begins,  all interaction
between the   teams and the judges will be limited
to    contest    activities.     All communication
(requests    for    clarification   of the problem
