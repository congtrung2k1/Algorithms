{$MODE DELPHI} (*This program uses 32-bit Integer [-2^31 .. 2^31 - 1]*)
program Analysis_Counting_2;
(*
IMPORTANT NOTES FOR COMPATIBILITY:
==================================
- This program is especially written for running under Windows 32 bit and
  Free Pascal IDE. Therefore, 32-bit Integer type is used to result in the
  best performance with the {$MODE DELPHI} compiler directive of FPK for
  Windows.
- If you use Borland Turbo Pascal 7 for DOS, you may have to reduce the
  data structure to deal with the limited memory. In addition, BP7 does not
  support 32-bit Integer type, it causes some Integer variables would have
  to be converted into LongInt variables.
- If you prefer to compile under Delphi, you can simply convert the source
  code as follows:
  + Replace the type "Text" with the type "TextFile"
  + Change all procedure calls "Assign(., .)" to "AssignFile(., .)" and
    "Close(.)" to "CloseFile(.)"
  + Remove the {$MODE DELPHI} and add the {$APPTYPE CONSOLE} compiler 
    directive to the beginning of this program
